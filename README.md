This repo contains Open Core Configuration for Hackintosh for Dell Precision 5520

Tested on Mac OS Big Sur works fine. but anything above that doesn't. I have tested with Ventura and Monterey. Ventura and Monterey installation gives following error after first restart. The error is about "Firmware update could not be found.".

Feel free to pull the repo and update it to work with latest versions of MAC OS.

My Laptop Specs: Dell Precision 5520 i7-7700HQ 16GB DDR4 Macron SSD 512GB

Note: Nvidia Quadro card does not work with MacOS only intel card is used for graphics acceleration. Everthing works fine Trackpad, usb ports, display, hotkeys, brightness and speakers. HDMI, Thunderbolt, Airdrop, Sleep not tested.

A big shotout to OpenCore and Github Community to make this happen.
